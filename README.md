# LavaLab Technical Challenge
My submission for the LavaLab Technical Challenge includes the UI provided in the Figma file, as well as additional functionality as shown when the user clicks on the floating action plus button. I implemented a FirebaseFirestore backend, which features a "projects" collection which contains documents that contain the fields "title" and "last edited". For now, the "last edited" is simply the time created. The documents shown are directly read from the Firestore database, and new documents are written into it when the plus button is clicked. Additionally, as shown in the Figma file, I implemented the side menu which shows when each section is selected.
